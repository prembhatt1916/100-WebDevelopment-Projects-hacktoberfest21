# Animated eyes following mouse cursor

Once I had seen a logo on one of the portfolio website, which follows mouse cursor. The Logo’s eyes follows mouse cursor, when user hover on the close tab button the eyes become red. That’s mean, the logo angry about close this website. This is a pretty cool thing in my opinion.

Today I finally found those types of following eyes effect. I think to share with all you guys. This following eyes effects not created by me but really it helped me learn Javascript. Hopefully, I will create different & amazing eyes follow mouse cursor effect in the future. This project contains animated eyes which follows your mouse cursor. This is a fun project to start with.
