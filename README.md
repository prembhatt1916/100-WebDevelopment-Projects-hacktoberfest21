# 100 Web Development Projects

Hello there, 

If you're reading this, then I'm sure you must be tired of searching for the right course or video for yourself. I know sometimes it becomes very tedious to find the right projects to make our concepts clear, thus I am planning to add 100+ Web-based projects that will help you understand all the concepts of Web Development. These projects will be a mixture of free and paid content over the internet. If you wish to walk along with me on this journey, all you have to do is star this repository and follow me on GitHub to stay updated. All you need to know is basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript. 

I will be updating this readme file regularly so that you can directly navigate to the project you want to work on.
Keep Learning !!

Cheers, 
Bhoomika Wavhal
